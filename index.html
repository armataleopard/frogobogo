        <div class="about-text">
            <p>Once upon a time in the sewers of the internet, a gang of radioactive frogs escaped the toilet after someone flushed their crypto gains away. These weren't your average amphibians – they mutated, developed diamond webbed feet, and vowed revenge on boring finance.</p>
            <p>Now they've taken over DeFi with their unhinged energy, creating the most ribbiting token the market has ever seen. $FROB isn't just a meme coin, it's a lifestyle – chaotic, unpredictable, and criminally undervalued by non-believers!</p>

                <p>"This frog just squatted 180kg and said ribbit. He doesn't even need a spotter, just pure froggy gains. Ask him about his nutrition plan and he'll just show you his collection of flies. Rumor has it his tadpole years were spent in a protein shake pond. When he jumps, the market pumps."</p>
